                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="info-card">

                        <p>Understanding of manga's development as a medium, including its publishing ecosystem, influential creators, and cultural impact.</p>

                <section class="content-section">
                    <h3>Content Philosophy</h3>
                    <p>Domic's approach to content creation is guided by several core principles:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Accessibility First:</strong> Complex information should be presented in a way that welcomes newcomers while still providing value to experienced readers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Accuracy Matters:</strong> Every claim should be verifiable, and speculation should be clearly distinguished from established facts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Respect for Source Material:</strong> Content should enhance appreciation for original works, not replace or diminish them.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reader-Focused:</strong> Every article should answer a genuine question or solve a real problem that readers face.</li>
                        <li><strong>Spoiler Sensitivity:</strong> Part of enjoying manga is experiencing the story fresh, so spoilers are always clearly marked.</li>
                    </ul>

                <section class="content-section">
                    <h3>Why This Site</h3>
                    <p>JJK Manga represents Domic's vision for what a dedicated fan resource should be. After years of reading manga and participating in fan communities, it became clear that quality information was often scattered across various forums, wikis, and social media posts. New readers especially struggled to find reliable guidance on where to start and how to approach long-running series.</p>
                    
                    <p>This site was created to be the resource Domic wished had existed when first discovering manga—a welcoming, comprehensive guide that respects readers' time and intelligence while providing genuinely useful information.</p>
                    
                    <p>The focus on this particular series came naturally. Its combination of innovative storytelling, complex characters, and cultural impact made it an ideal subject for in-depth coverage. As one of the defining manga of its generation, it deserves a dedicated resource that can do justice to its depth and significance.</p>
