                <div class="blog-post-content content-section">
                    <p>One of the most fascinating aspects of the JJK manga is its meticulously crafted power system. Unlike many shonen series that rely on vague power levels or simple "who's stronger" matchups, Gege Akutami created a complex system where strategy, technique, and creativity matter as much as raw power.</p>

                    <h2>What Is Cursed Energy?</h2>
                    <p>At its foundation, cursed energy flows from negative human emotions—fear, hatred, anger, and sorrow. Every human unconsciously leaks small amounts of cursed energy, which accumulates in places associated with negative emotions and eventually gives birth to curses.</p>

                    <p>Jujutsu sorcerers are individuals who can perceive, control, and weaponize this cursed energy. The ability to manipulate cursed energy is partially innate but can also be developed through training. However, the ceiling of one's potential is largely determined by natural talent.</p>

                    <h2>Cursed Techniques</h2>
                    <p>Cursed techniques are the specialized abilities that sorcerers develop to combat curses. These techniques are often inherited through bloodlines, which is why certain families like the Zenin, Gojo, and Kamo clans hold such prominence in jujutsu society.</p>

                    <p>Each cursed technique has specific rules and limitations that govern its use. These constraints aren't arbitrary—they're part of what makes the technique function. By accepting limitations, sorcerers can actually strengthen their abilities through binding vows.</p>

                    <h3>Innate Techniques vs. Learned Abilities</h3>
                    <p>Innate techniques are abilities a sorcerer is born with and cannot be changed or replaced. Gojo's Limitless, Megumi's Ten Shadows, and Todo's Boogie Woogie are all examples of innate techniques. These define a sorcerer's combat style and strategic options.</p>

                    <p>In contrast, abilities like cursed energy reinforcement, simple domain, and reverse cursed technique can be learned by any sorcerer with sufficient talent and training.</p>

                    <h2>Domain Expansion</h2>
                    <p>Domain Expansion represents the pinnacle of jujutsu sorcery. By manifesting their innate domain—essentially a pocket dimension infused with their cursed technique—a sorcerer creates an environment where their attacks become inescapable.</p>

                    <p>The power of a domain comes from its guaranteed hit mechanism. Within an active domain, the user's attacks will land without fail, bypassing normal evasion or defense. This makes domain battles incredibly tactical, as sorcerers must either counter with their own domain or find ways to disrupt the expansion.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        "A domain is the crystallization of a sorcerer's technique and accumulated experience. It reveals everything about who they are as a fighter."
                    </blockquote>

                    <h2>Binding Vows and Heavenly Restrictions</h2>
                    <p>Binding vows allow sorcerers to exchange one thing for another, strengthening certain abilities by accepting limitations elsewhere. These can be made with oneself or with others, and breaking a binding vow results in severe consequences.</p>

                    <p>Heavenly Restrictions are binding vows made at birth, trading one aspect of a person for enhanced abilities in another area. Mechamaru traded his bodily functionality for massive cursed energy reserves, while Toji traded all cursed energy for superhuman physical capabilities.</p>

                    <h2>Reverse Cursed Technique</h2>
                    <p>While cursed energy is inherently destructive, reverse cursed technique converts negative energy into positive energy capable of healing. This ability is exceptionally rare and difficult to master, with only a handful of characters demonstrating proficiency.</p>

                    <p>Reverse cursed technique is crucial for high-level battles, as it allows sorcerers to regenerate from injuries that would otherwise be fatal. Characters like Gojo and Sukuna can use reverse cursed technique continuously, giving them enormous advantages in prolonged fights.</p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>The cursed energy system in JJK represents one of the most well-designed power systems in modern manga. Its internal consistency, strategic depth, and the way it integrates with character development make fights genuinely engaging rather than simple power comparisons.</p>

                    <p>Understanding these mechanics enhances appreciation for the tactical battles throughout the series. Each confrontation becomes a puzzle where readers can analyze options and predict outcomes based on established rules.</p>
